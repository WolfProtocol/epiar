    <name>Altaire Corp. NM66 Sublight Thrusters</name>
    <description>The NM66 has been established as the standard engine for all small and medium ships.

It doesn't have enough force to propel large or carrier class starships.</description>

  <engine>
    <name>Ion Engines</name>
    <description>The Ion Engine works by accelerating a stream of charged particles to near relativistic speeds before ejecting them.

The Solaran Colonies have adopted Ion Engines into all of their standard ships due to their incredible acceletations.

Some Carrier class starships in the Terran Navy also use Ion Engines as nothing else would be enough to move them.</description>
