Hi there,

I'm a programmer for the open source, free game Epiar (epiar.net) and I was wondering if we could use:

xxkonanandpain.deviantart.com/â€¦

on our main menu screen? We would credit you and provide a link to your DeviantART page or wherever you'd like. If possible, getting your permission to place it under a Creative Commons license would be great.

If you agree, we'd use it! The game is free, open source, and downloaded by a few thousand people when releases come out. Please understand those few thousand people would be gaining a copy of your artwork via the game download.

If you feel uncomfortable, no worries, just thought I'd ask!
