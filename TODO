Clean up trade tab - perhaps by creating a proper UI::Table
In-game dialog to save/load/change options instead of kicking player out to main menu
Menu<->Game transitions should fade to black and/or menu/game rendering
Creating a new player shouldn't cause the button click sound twice
Welcome dialog should not be in a different area than game start
